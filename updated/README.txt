Installation
============
Simply unpack the .tar.gz file in a directory of your choosing. Once unpacked, type "make" into 
the command line terminal. The executable is MP2D. Make a path to the directory in which
you made MP2D in your .bashrc or .cshrc. 

The files GrimmeC6.txt and UCHF_daug_C6.txt contain the CKS and UCHF dispersion coefficients
respectively. 

The examples/ directory contains some sample inputs.
